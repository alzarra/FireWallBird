Game description:
it's a flappy bird style, all you have to do is to jump by touching the screen or clicking it to pass through the obsticals

feedback from student:
we need to resize the bird to make it a challenging game, add music and sound effect, add animation to the bird, add a menu screen, some of them didn't like the game 


future feature:
can be adjested to work on andriod, can added leveling, and point system.
